Initially, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build websites.\n\nMy first project was a simple website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (~mid-2021).\nAs I progressed, I first focused on React.js and after a while switched over to Next.js.\n\nI am currently also making a apprenticeship as an IT Guy at Georg Fischer AG, where I lean a lot about how big businesses operate."
