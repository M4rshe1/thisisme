# The start

So before we dive in to how my adventure with Typst went, let's start by how I found out about it and also introduced a coworker to it (that was more amazed than me).

As usual I went to work this morning, hence im an apprentice I often switch departments.
And I recently had switch to a new one.

Also as part of my apprentice I have to make a documentation about what I learned.

## The thought

So I begun to create a Word document with my template as all the 3 years of my apprentice before.
But then it struck me: "What if I make my documentation in LateX?".
I had this thought in my mind for a while now, because a friend of mine introduced me to it and I also wanted to try [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com).

## LateX & Overleaf

In the evening, after work, I begun to thinker and started a overleaf docker container on my home server.
I tried it for a bit but quickly started to dislike the way LaTeX worked and the syntax was structured.

So I went to bed...

# Love at first sight

The next morning when I woke up I had some time to spare until I had to leave for work so I watch youtube and that is when it happened.
I saw a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI2e0o3sIVM) on my feed...

As I was watching the video I realized that this was exactly that, what I hoped LaTeX would be.
Easy to write text, functionally designed, easy to read syntax and not all the clutter LaTex comes with.
I immediately fell in love with it.

When I arrived at work I started to convert my Word document into Typst, and o boy was it great.

Starting by how you define the layout of a document, custom templates, formatting specific parts and elements, the functional syntax and how easy it is to write when you are set up.

# Examples

Let me show you some examples:
